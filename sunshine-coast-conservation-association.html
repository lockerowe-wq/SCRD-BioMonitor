Our work spans the Sunshine Coast Natural Resource District — 2 million hectares of coastal temperate rainforest and marine ecosystems in the territories of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, shíshálh, Tla'amin, Klahoose, and Homalco First Nations. Home to over 60,000 residents from Howe Sound to Homathko." This organization is heavily involved in advocating for the conservation of biodiversity on the Coast.
