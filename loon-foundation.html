        <h1>The Loon Foundation</h1>
        <p>"The Loon Foundation was founded in 2002 as the Ruby Lake Lagoon Nature Reserve Society", and since that time, "our scope has expanded well beyond the Ruby Lake Lagoon, and in 2020 we changed our name to The Loon Foundation to better represent our wide reaching efforts to conserve biodiversity and foster environmental stewardship." In addition to community science and education, and in collaboration with the shíshálh Nation, this organization is leading the build of the Pender Harbour Ocean Discovery Station. (Quotes from the Foundation's website.)</p>
        <p><strong>Biomonitoring:</strong> Yes, there are several biomonitoring and community science programs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forage fish</li>
            <li>Seagrass</li>
            <li>Invasive species</li>
            <li>Pinnipeds</li>
            <li>Salmonid escapement</li>
            <li>Juvenile escapement</li>
            <li>Larval crabs</li>
            <li>Coastal water nearshore birds</li>
            <li>Loons</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data from these programs are typically shared with government agencies and NGOs.</p>
        <p>The Foundation also organizes an annual BioBlitz, and findings are recorded on iNaturalist.</p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> Yes. Occasional educational gatherings and a summer camp for children typically occur in any given year. See the website for upcoming events.</p>
        <p><strong>Biomonitoring and Community Science Volunteer Opportunities:</strong> Yes. Contact the Society to determine current opportunities.</p>
        <p>In addition to the monitoring programs, the Foundation is engaged in several other activities aimed at enhancing biodiversity and its appreciation on the coast, and there are volunteer opportunities in these other programs.</p>
