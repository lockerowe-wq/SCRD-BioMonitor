        <h1>Pender Harbour Wildlife Society</h1>
        <p>Founded in 1979, the Pender Harbour and District Wildlife Society has sought to reverse the damage caused by human habitation and improve the life of flora and fauna across the length of the Sunshine Coast. With projects that promote the wellbeing of wildlife, remove invasive plants, and reach out to the community, we believe in improving our environment for all of its inhabitants.</p>
        <p><strong>Biomonitoring:</strong> The Society organizes the Pender Harbour Annual Christmas Bird Count, one of two Christmas bird counts in the Sunshine Coast Regional District, the other centred on Roberts Creek.</p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> Yes. Occasional educational gatherings, including guest speakers, occur in any given year. See the website for upcoming events.</p>
        <p><strong>Biomonitoring and Community Science Volunteer Opportunities:</strong> No current programs.</p>
        <p>The Society is engaged in several activities aimed at enhancing biodiversity and its appreciation in the Pender Harbour area, and there are volunteer opportunities in these other programs. Contact the Society to determine current opportunities.</p>
