        <h1>Sunshine Coast Wildlife Project</h1>
        <p>We are a small group of biologists working to conserve the Sunshine Coast's precious natural heritage for generations to come. Since 2006, we have been working with community partners to help conserve wildlife and their habitats. Goals of the project include provision of scientific information to guide conservation and aid in the recovery of species at risk, to restore and enhance wildlife habitat and increase the area of land conserved for wildlife, and to facilitate community participation in stewardship efforts.</p>
        <p><strong>Biomonitoring:</strong> The Project is involved in a variety of biomonitoring projects, including those centred on goshawks, turtles, snakes, amphibians, bats and owls. These programs are often in collaboration with university researchers.</p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> Yes. The Project provides workshops, seminars and youth programs centred on biodiversity and conservation. Contact the Project for upcoming events.</p>
