        <h1>Sunshine Coast Salmonid Enhancement Society</h1>
        <p>The Sunshine Coast Salmonid Enhancement Society is a charitable organization dedicated to sustaining and building salmon stocks in local waterways and facilitating public education regarding salmonid habitat and life cycles. In 1992 the SCSES, with the help of the local community, raised $150,000 to purchase the hatchery. Since that time we have been operating this facility as a community based enhancement hatchery. We work with four species of Pacific salmon to help with the natural production of Chapman Creek.</p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> The Society offers a summer camp for children, focusing on salmon and local natural history.</p>
        <p><strong>Volunteer Opportunities:</strong> Opportunities to be involved with hatchery work, including fin clipping, fish transfers, fish releases, spawning, incubation work, and fish feeding.</p>
