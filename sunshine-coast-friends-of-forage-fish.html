        <h1>Sunshine Coast Friends of Forage Fish</h1>
        <p>"Our group collects spawning data on the beaches of the Sunshine Coast, British Columbia. By sifting small beach sediment samples, we hope to find forage fish eggs, a sure sign of a positive spawning beach. Our team of dedicated volunteers are sampling every two to four weeks, depending on season, to establish whether or not our beaches are valuable spawning habitats for smelt or sand lance. We are currently sampling a beach in Gibsons and one in Davis Bay." (Quoted from the group's website).</p>
