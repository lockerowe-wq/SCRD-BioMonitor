    <h1>Biomonitoring and Community Science on the Sunshine Coast</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Sunshine Coast in British Columbia is an 180 km stretch of rugged maritime landscape along the mainland's southwest coast, nestled between Howe Sound and Desolation Sound. It includes or overlaps with the unceded territories of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, shíshálh, Tla'amin, Klahoose, and Homalco First Nations.</p>
    
    <p>The Sunshine Coast features a narrow coastal lowland flanked by mountains, deep fjords such as Jervis Inlet, and a rugged, island dotted shoreline fronting the Strait of Georgia.</p>
    
    <p>The region supports rich biodiversity anchored by Coastal Western Hemlock and Coastal Douglas fir forests, old growth stands, wetlands, estuaries, and marine waters. Terrestrial habitats host black bears, cougars, elk, wolves, coyotes, black tailed deer, bald eagles, marbled murrelets, and many other species. Coastal and marine ecosystems include kelp forests, rare glass sponge reefs, salmon streams, and tide pools that are home to molluscs, sea anemones, and fish. Resident and Bigg's orcas, seals, sea lions, and migratory birds rely on these productive waters and shorelines.</p>
    
    <p>Paired with its extraordinary biodiversity, the Sunshine Coast has an unusual number of formal and informal non profit organizations whose primary purpose is to conserve, enhance, and steward biodiversity. These organizations are often involved in biomonitoring programs and in education about biodiversity on the coast.</p>
    
    <h2>Volunteer and Education Opportunities</h2>
    <p>The primary purpose of this document is to introduce those Sunshine Coast non profit organizations that offer opportunities for community members to become involved in biomonitoring as volunteers or to take advantage of the educational opportunities they provide. We focus on opportunities within the Sunshine Coast Regional District, extending from Langdale to Egmont.</p>
    
    <h2>Organizations</h2>
    
    <div class="organization">
        <h3>The Loon Foundation</h3>
        <p>"The Loon Foundation was founded in 2002 as the Ruby Lake Lagoon Nature Reserve Society," and since that time, "our scope has expanded well beyond the Ruby Lake Lagoon, and in 2020 we changed our name to The Loon Foundation to better represent our wide reaching efforts to conserve biodiversity and foster environmental stewardship." In addition to community science and education, and in collaboration with the shíshálh Nation, this organization is leading the build of the Pender Harbour Ocean Discovery Station.</p>
