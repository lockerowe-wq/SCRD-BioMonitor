    <h1>Biomonitoring and Community Science on the Sunshine Coast</h1>

    <p>The Sunshine Coast in British Columbia is an 180 km stretch of rugged maritime landscape along the mainland's southwest coast, nestled between Howe Sound and Desolation Sound. It includes or overlaps with the unceded territories of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, shíshálh, Tla'amin, Klahoose, and Homalco First Nations. The Sunshine Coast features a narrow coastal lowland flanked by mountains, deep fjords such as Jervis Inlet, and a rugged, island dotted shoreline fronting the Strait of Georgia.</p>

    <p>The region supports rich biodiversity anchored by Coastal Western Hemlock and Coastal Douglas fir forests, old growth stands, wetlands, estuaries, and marine waters. Terrestrial habitats host black bears, cougars, elk, wolves, coyotes, black tailed deer, bald eagles, marbled murrelets, and many other species. Coastal and marine ecosystems include kelp forests, rare glass sponge reefs, salmon streams, and tide pools that are home to molluscs, sea anemones, and fish. Resident and Bigg's orcas, seals, sea lions, and migratory birds rely on these productive waters and shorelines. Protected areas, including over a dozen provincial parks, help conserve this web of habitats and species.</p>

    <p>Paired with its extraordinary biodiversity, the Sunshine Coast has an unusual number of formal and informal non profit organizations whose primary purpose is to conserve, enhance, and steward biodiversity. These organizations are often involved in biomonitoring programs and in education about biodiversity on the coast.</p>

    <p>The primary purpose of this document is to introduce those Sunshine Coast non profit organizations that offer opportunities for community members to become involved in biomonitoring as volunteers or to take advantage of the educational opportunities they provide. Here we focus on opportunities within the Sunshine Coast Regional District, extending from Langdale to Egmont. Following the introduction of opportunities for volunteering and education in biodiversity, the next section describes in more detail the sampling regimes used by each organization in their biomonitoring programs and the sites used for their data storage. The aims here are to allow different organizations to learn from one another about current practices across the coast, and perhaps improve them with input from experts in the field, and to provide quick access to the data collected.</p>

    <p>All of the organizations highlighted here are engaged in much more than biomonitoring, community science, and education. Their activities range from beach clean ups to political advocacy for conservation, and building fish ladders to entire biodiversity dedicated facilities. Go to their websites to see their remarkable and sustained community based work for nature.</p>
