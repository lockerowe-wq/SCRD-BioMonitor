Through our well-structured conservation projects, we've made a tangible impact." "Our conservation work is placed-based, centred around Gibsons Harbour, Átl'ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound, and the Salish Sea. We work with and bring together partners to support stewardship projects that help sustain healthy coastal life. Our goal is to inspire and educate the community to engage in pro-environmental behavior." (Quotes from the Society webpage).
