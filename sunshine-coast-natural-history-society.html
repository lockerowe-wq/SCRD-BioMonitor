        <h1>Sunshine Coast Natural History Society</h1>
        <p>Although originally set up to manage Sechelt Marsh, the Sunshine Coast Natural History Society now caters for a wide range of natural history interests on the Sunshine Coast of BC. There is a focus on birds; however, interests span natural history, including bats, dragonflies, and butterflies.</p>
        <p><strong>Biomonitoring:</strong> The Society organizes the Sunshine Coast Annual Christmas Bird Count, one of two Christmas bird counts in the Sunshine Coast Regional District, the other centred on Pender Harbour.</p>
        <p><strong>Education:</strong> Yes. Meetings include discussion of recent natural history sightings. Other educational events include nature walks and regular invited speakers. See the website for upcoming events.</p>
